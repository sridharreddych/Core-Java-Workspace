/*
Encapsulation – refers to keeping all the related members (variables and methods) together in an object. Specifying
member variables as private can hide the variables and methods. Objects should hide their inner workings from the
outside view. Good encapsulation improves code modularity by preventing objects interacting with each other in
an unexpected way, which in turn makes future development and refactoring efforts easy. CO
Being able to encapsulate members of a class is important for security and integrity. We can protect variables from
unacceptable values. The sample code above describes how encapsulation can be used to protect the MyMarks object
from having negative values. Any modification to member variable “vmarks” can only be carried out through the setter
method setMarks(int mark). This prevents the object “MyMarks” from having any negative values by throwing an
exception.*/
